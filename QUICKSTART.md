- **Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/api/
- **Unsplash**: https://unsplash.com/developers
- **Pixabay**: https://pixabay.com/api/docs/

All keys are **100% free** with generous limits!

## 5. Tips for Best Results

- **Script Length**: 5-10 sentences work best (30-90 seconds)
- **Clear Topics**: Specific subjects get better visuals
- **Natural Language**: Write how you'd speak
- **Keywords**: Include visual keywords (e.g., "office", "sunset", "technology")

## Troubleshooting

### "FFmpeg not found"
```bash
# Install FFmpeg:
brew install ffmpeg  # macOS
# or
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg  # Linux
```

### "Module not found"
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Video takes too long
- First video generation installs AI models (one-time)
- Subsequent videos are much faster
- Typical generation time: 2-5 minutes
